          Brachi is a game created by Aidan, Daymon, Glyn, Jake, and Sonny as a project
          for PHYS 350; a course on classical mechanics at the University of British
          Columbia. We aimed to expand on the classic Brachistochrone problem by incorporating
          more advanced potentials in a fun and competitive format for our classmates to
          enjoy.

          A lot of work went on behind the scenes to generate the ideal solution curves
          for the potentials we selected. Our GitHub readme contains a report for this
          project outlining the physics and math behind these ideal solution curves. The
          report also contains some instructions on how to run and play Brachi for
          yourself, as well as some technical details behind animating and simulating
          the curves you draw.

          Thanks for playing!
