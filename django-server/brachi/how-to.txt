To set up and run the Django server locally:
  1. Make sure you are using Python 3 and that you have Django installed (if not,
     typing "pip install django" in the Command Line should do the trick).
  2. Go to the "brachi\django-server\brachi" directory on your local machine and
     open a Command Line or PowerShell window there.
  3. If it is your first time running the server, or the first time in a while,
     type "python manage.py migrate". This will add the appropriate tables to the
     SQLite database on your machine.
  4. Type "python manage.py runserver" to start the server. Open your web browser
     and go to "127.0.0.1:8000/navigation/title" in the address bar. That's it!

To set up and run the server for EVERYONE on the same Wi-Fi node as you:
  1. Make sure you are on the wifi network that you want to deploy the server to.
  2. Find the IPv4 address of the server; in Windows you can click the wifi symbol
     in the bar at the bottom of the screen and click Properties on the wifi you
     are connected to.
  3. Go to "brachi\django-server\brachi\brachi\settings.py" and scroll down to
     the "ALLOWED_HOSTS" variable and add the IPv4 address to the list. It should
     now look something like: "ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['128.189.231.64']" but with your
     IPv4 address. Some routers may need to be configured to work with the server,
     but as of March 2018 "ubcsecure" works just fine.
  4. In the command line, type: "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000" to
     run the server (this SHOULD be all zeroes NOT the IPv4 address of the router).
  5. Anyone on the same wifi network can now go to the following url to access
     the server: "128.189.231.64:8000/navigation/title".
