To set up and run the Django server locally:
  1. Make sure you are using Python 3 and that you have Django installed (if not,
     typing "pip install django" in the Command Line should do the trick).
  2. Go to the "brachi\django-server\brachi" directory on your local machine and
     open a Command Line or PowerShell window there.
  3. If it is your first time running the server, or the first time in a while,
     type "python manage.py migrate". This will add the appropriate tables to the
     SQLite database on your machine.
  4. Type "python manage.py runserver" to start the server. Open your web browser
     and go to "127.0.0.1:8000/navigation/title" in the address bar. That's it!

To set up and run the server for EVERYONE on the same wifi node as you:
  1. TODO: finish this!
